<h1>Smart Zebra Crossing with CO<sub>2</sub> emission detection </h1>
<p>In this project we have integrated smart zebra crossing with CO2 emission detector to notify the traffic about air quality index and off the vehicle<p>

<p>The Smart Zebra Crossing mini project aims to enhance pedestrian safety and convenience by incorporating intelligent features such as automatic path rotation and environmental monitoring. This project integrates servo motors, DC motors, and a gas sensor to create an interactive and responsive zebra crossing system. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:

**Key Components:**
<ol>
<li>2 Servo Motors: Servo motors are used to control the rotating paths of the zebra crossing. These motors will move parts of the path, enabling pedestrian-friendly behavior, such as rotating the crossing paths when necessary. The servo motors will rotate at specific angles to either allow vehicles to pass or make way for pedestrians.</li>

<li> DC Motors: The DC motors are used to control the movement of rotating platforms or paths in the zebra crossing. These motors can be used to rotate or pivot the crossing, allowing the system to switch between pedestrian and vehicle paths. The DC motors can be activated based on the detection of vehicles or pedestrians, facilitating automated adjustments to the crossing.</li>

<li>Gas Sensor: The gas sensor, such as the MQ-2 or MQ-9, is used to detect the presence of gases like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), or smoke. This sensor plays a critical role in ensuring safety at the zebra crossing, as it can monitor environmental conditions and trigger the rotation of the paths to prioritize pedestrian movement or alert authorities if dangerous levels of gases are detected.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Objective:</h2><br>
The primary objective of the Smart Zebra Crossing project is to create a dynamic system that:
<ul>
<li>Detects pedestrians and vehicles using appropriate sensors.</li>
<li>Rotates paths automatically using servos and DC motors to accommodate pedestrians safely.</li>
<li>Monitors air quality using the gas sensor to detect hazardous conditions and adjust the system accordingly, ensuring a safer environment.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Working Principle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatic Rotation of Paths:The project uses the servo motors and DC motors to create rotating paths that adjust based on the presence of pedestrians and vehicles. When a pedestrian is detected, the path rotates to provide a safe crossing. Similarly, the system ensures that vehicles are given the crossing path when no pedestrians are detected.</li>

<li>Gas Detection:The gas sensor continuously monitors the air for the presence of harmful gases such as CO or smoke. If dangerous gases are detected, the system automatically triggers actions such as turning off traffic lights or rotating the path to guide pedestrians away from potentially hazardous areas.</li>

<li>Response to Environmental Factors:The system can adjust its behavior based on real-time readings from the gas sensor. For instance, if harmful gas levels exceed a safe threshold, the system may trigger safety alarms or activate an emergency mode to protect the public.</li>

<li>Pedestrian and Vehicle Detection:Additional sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, could be added to detect the presence of pedestrians and vehicles. Based on the sensor inputs, the servo motors and DC motors will adjust the paths accordingly.</li>
