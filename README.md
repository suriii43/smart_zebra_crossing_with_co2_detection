<h1>Smart Zebra Crossing with CO<sub>2</sub> emission detection </h1>
<p>In this project we have integrated smart zebra crossing with CO2 emission detector to notify the traffic about air quality index and off the vehicle<p>

<p>The Smart Zebra Crossing mini project aims to enhance pedestrian safety and convenience by incorporating intelligent features such as automatic path rotation and environmental monitoring. This project integrates servo motors, DC motors, and a gas sensor to create an interactive and responsive zebra crossing system. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:

**Key Components:**
<ol>
<li>2 Servo Motors: Servo motors are used to control the rotating paths of the zebra crossing. These motors will move parts of the path, enabling pedestrian-friendly behavior, such as rotating the crossing paths when necessary. The servo motors will rotate at specific angles to either allow vehicles to pass or make way for pedestrians.</li>

<li> DC Motors: The DC motors are used to control the movement of rotating platforms or paths in the zebra crossing. These motors can be used to rotate or pivot the crossing, allowing the system to switch between pedestrian and vehicle paths. The DC motors can be activated based on the detection of vehicles or pedestrians, facilitating automated adjustments to the crossing.</li>

<li>Gas Sensor: The gas sensor, such as the MQ-2 or MQ-9, is used to detect the presence of gases like carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), or smoke. This sensor plays a critical role in ensuring safety at the zebra crossing, as it can monitor environmental conditions and trigger the rotation of the paths to prioritize pedestrian movement or alert authorities if dangerous levels of gases are detected.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Objective:</h2><br>
The primary objective of the Smart Zebra Crossing project is to create a dynamic system that:
<ul>
<li>Detects pedestrians and vehicles using appropriate sensors.</li>
<li>Rotates paths automatically using servos and DC motors to accommodate pedestrians safely.</li>
<li>Monitors air quality using the gas sensor to detect hazardous conditions and adjust the system accordingly, ensuring a safer environment.</li>
